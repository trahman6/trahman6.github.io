      <p>The rapid growth of information technology (IT) in today's business landscape is crucial for enhancing accuracy and efficiency across various industries. However, this expansion often gives rise to ethical dilemmas, particularly when the balance between IT use and workforce harmony is disrupted. Organizations prioritizing productivity over ethics risk undermining workforce commitment and motivation. Long-term success hinges on understanding and upholding professional responsibilities and IT ethics.</p>

        <li><strong>Applied Ethics:</strong> Deals with ethical principles in specific situations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Ethical Principles in IT</h2>
